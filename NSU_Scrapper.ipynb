      " Athletics Club North South University Athletics Club (NSUAC) since its establishment in 1995 have been maneuvering all the sports affairs of North South University. The club started with the name of North South University Sports Club which later was changed to the present name on Spring 2016. It's been 24 years of NSUAC since its birth and is one of the oldest clubs of NSU. The club has represented NSU at many Inter University sports events in different sports and have brought prestige for NSU in terms of sports. The objective of NSUAC is to bring out the sports talents of NSU to spot light and prepare them well enough to represent NSU at the Inter University level through sports. Following this objective NSUAC has been successful since its journey. NSUAC represented NSU at various sporting event and walked out as champions. NSU have been champion in sports tournaments like Cricket, Football, Badminton, Table tennis, Basketball in many occasions.   NSUAC basically has six main events annually alongside some other small ones. All these events have been very effective in finding out all the sports talents in NSU. NSU Cricket League (NCL): NCL is a cricket tournament with two categories. One where all the other clubs participate to showcase their expertise in cricket. The other one is for the staffs and faculties of NSU where they participate department wise. NSU Football League (NFL): NFL is one of the most glorious events of NSUAC where all the clubs participate and battle it out to bring glory for their club in football. Since 2017 NSUAC has managed to arrange a female segment in this event. NSU Shuttle Masters: NSU Shuttle Masters is an intra NSU badminton tournament. This event has two segments, one for the students and the other for the faculties and staffs. The participants can take part there in men's single, men’s double, women's single, women's double and mixed double category. NSU Intra Batch Cricket Tournament: This is a proper T20 cricket tournament. The most recent six batches of NSU makes their team and participate in the tournament. The batches are divided their admission year wise. NSU Intra Batch Football Tournament: This is a football tournament among the most recent six batches of NSU. This and the intra batch cricket are similar to each other just the sport changes basically. NSU Sports Carnival: NSU Sports Carnival Is the largest sporting event in NSU arranged by NSUAC. This event is consisting of five sports which are table-tennis, basketball, badminton, football and cricket. NSUAC is planning to make this even larger from this year by pushing NSU Sports Carnival to Inter University level. Other than this tournament we also arrange award distribution ceremonies for the athletes of NSU known as “Night of the Knights”. Organizing all these events every year is a huge and tough task. Keeping this in mind we recruit members for the club thrice every year at the beginning of the semester. Members are recruited through personal interview and the best and dedicated are chosen to be a part of the journey of NSUAC, which becomes more of a family to them then club later on. Being one of the first clubs of NSU, North South University Athletics Club is now running on full throttle and trying to develop at every single step and fulfil its objective. The efficient members work their heart out to uphold and protect the glory of the name “North South University Athletics Club”.

      " Center of Excellence in Higher Education The First Private University in Bangladesh Dr. Muktadir Shahid Hossain Full Time FacultyAssociate Professor Ph.D. in Pharmaceutical Biology, University of Tokyo, Japan Phone: +880-2-55668200 Ext: 1919 Email: muktadir.hossain01@northsouth.edu Office: Curriculum Vitae             Muktadir Shahid Hossain is an Associate Professor of the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology of NSU. He joined the department in Janauary 2017. Muktadir S. Hossain completed his Ph.D. at the University of Tokyo, Japan in 2004 where he showed that quiescent (G0) phase cells of multicellular eukaryotes like mammals and insects require DNA topoisomeras II enzyme for the re-entry into the cell cycle, whereas the unicellular eukaryotes like yeast do not. The title of his Ph.D. dissertation is \"Requirement for DNA topoisomerase II during the G0-to-S phase transition in mammalian and insect cells\". In the University of Tokyo as a Ph.D. student, he participated in the isolation of temperature-sensitive mutants of the pathogenic bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus. In the University of Tokyo as a Ph.D. student, he also showed that the DNA double-strand break-inducing drugs that are used to treat cancner can induce myogenic differentiation in cultured cells of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. In the University of Tokyo as a Research Assistant, he established the larvae of the silk moth, Bombyx mori as animal model to study purified toxins from pathogenic bacteria like S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by injection. He joined the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, USA as a post-doctoral fellow where he identified certain transcription factors that regulate initiation of embryonic muscle differentiation in D. melanogaster. Then, he joined the Shanghai Institutes of Biological Sciences, China as a Senior Research Fellow to show that the evolutionarily conserved transcription factor, FoxO is required for the activation of ecdysone signaling during starvation for better survival of larvae of both B. mori and D. melanogaster. In Andong National University, South Korea, he showed as a Visiting Fellow along with other researchers that the ICA69 gene is a cytosolic phospholipase A2 that participates in the immunity of the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua, an important pest insect. As a Research Professor in Chonbuk National University, South Korea, he introduced the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technique in the pest insect-killing fungus, Beauveria bassiana which is useful not only to identify the molecular mechanism of pathogenicity of B. bassiana towards insect pests by gene knock-out but also to improve the pathogenicity of the fungus by overexpressing virulence genes. Since B. bassiana is harmless to humans but can kill pest insects efficiently, it can be used in the context of Bangladesh where the use of chemical pesticides is widespread to control insect pests to increase crop production in an environmentally friendly way. He is also trying to identify novel anticancer drugs from biological extracts by using silkworm larvae as a cancer model via knocking out tumor-suppressor genes using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology.  List of Publications as an NSU employee:  1.

NSU also continues to be the only private university in Bangladesh to be ranked in the QS Rankings by Subjects. Business and Management Studies secured the Global Rank of 351-400, ascending 50 spots from last year. Computer Science and Information Systems secured the Global Rank of 601-650. This year's QS World University Rankings reveals the top 1,000 universities from around the world, covering 80 different locations. Over 5,500 universities were evaluated and considered for inclusion. The QS World University Rankings by Subject ranks the world's top universities in individual subject areas, covering 51 subjects. Each of the subject rankings is compiled using four sources. The first two of these are QS's global surveys of academics and employers, which are used to assess institution's international reputation in each subject. The second two indicators assess research impact, based on research citations per paper and h-index in the relevant subject. These are sourced from Elsevier's Scopus database, the world's most comprehensive research citations database. These four components are combined to produce the results for each of the subject rankings, with weightings adapted for each discipline. North South University continued to hold its leading position across all ranking platforms. North South University (NSU) has proudly held its undisputed spot as the #1 private university in Bangladesh in the latest QS World University Rankings - Asia 2021. NSU is the first and only private university in Bangladesh to have also entered the QS Graduate Employability Rankings among the World's Top 500 institutions in 2020.

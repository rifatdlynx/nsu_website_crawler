      " In general, NSU is modeled on US universities and follows their academic features such as semester systems, credit hours, letter grades, etc. When first introduced, its curricula of undergraduate programs such as Economics, Business, and Computer Science were largely modeled on the curricula of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and were duly approved by the University Grants Commission (UGC) of Bangladesh, the highest accrediting authority of higher education of the country. NSU has an International Advisory Board, comprised of scholars from all over the world, to counsel and to suggest improvements on academic matters of the university. The university is delivering a substantial general education curriculum, has a strategic plan, and has initiated and implemented student instructional learning assessment for degree programs and courses and is in the process of developing the infrastructure for evaluation of institutional effectiveness for its institutional accreditation. ate a university in the private sector, they took the entire burden on themselves and extended their best efforts in assisting the then government in formulating the relevant law and enacting it. Subsequently, the government, pursuant to the newly enacted law the Private University Act (PUA)-1992 (now repealed by PUA-2010), approved the establishment of NSU. The University was formally inaugurated on 10 February 1993 and started its journey in a very modest way. Later, in 2012, the NSU Foundation, in the light of the PUA 2010 and as instructed by the Ministry of Education and the University Grants Commission, formed the NSU Trust with the same group of people as the Foundation and vested the entire management and administration of NSU in its Board of Trustees (BOT). The Honorable President of the People's Republic of Bangladesh is the Chancellor of NSU. The Syndicate is next to the BOT and is headed by the Vice-Chancellor. The Vice-Chancellor is also the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the University. He is responsible for managing the administrative and academic affairs of the university as per the Private University Act (PUA 2010), and implementing the policy guidelines set by the BOT. The Vice-Chancellor is assisted by a Pro Vice-Chancellor and a Treasurer. All of them are appointed by the Honorable Chancellor on recommendation of the BOT. \n"

      " Center of Excellence in Higher Education The First Private University in Bangladesh Department of Architecture Notice About Us The Department of Architecture at NSU turns out creative professionals equipped to realize imagined spaces on the socio-economic and cultural landscape of Bangladesh sensitively, responsibly and with a critical reference to global phenomena. What sets the school apart is its dedication to the fundamentals of the creative process and its grounding in the socio-cultural milieu that gives depth and meaning to the discipline of architecture. Whilst providing access to materials, advanced technology, a dedicated architectural library and workshop and the most highly qualified faculty to guide the studios and develop the philosophical core of the discipline, the school remains loyal to its motto of simplicity and practicality. Thus the carefully choreographed journey through experimentation and self-discovery inherent in architectural education is punctuated here with study tours, lectures and seminars with experienced practitioners, workshops and hands on experiences to connect the students to the ground realities. The department currently offers a Bachelor of Architecture B.Arch degree that is a 5 year 170 credit program with concentrations in studio, theory, optional and elective courses. The program curriculum is approved by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and Accredited by the Institute of Architects Bangladesh (IAB). It maintains the educational standards and criteria of bodies such as the International Union of Architects (UIA), the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Commonwealth Association of Architects (CAA), National Architectural Accrediting Board, USA (NAAB), etc to ensure a well rounded education that is at par with international programs in architecture. Graduates of the school have been accepted into Masters Programs at Columbia University, McGill University and DIA, Germany. Others are working at some of the most well reputed practices in Dhaka including Volume Zero, Architecton and Rafiq Azam Architects. Our Vision Vision of the Department of Architecture: The vision of the Department of Architecture at North South University is to be the leader in the field of Architectural Education in the region. The Department aspires to prepare master builders of the future based on three guiding principles: critical thinking developed through the awareness and knowledge of the arts and the sciences, creative approach by believing in the human capacity for innovation as a tool for the betterment of self and the society; and ethical responsibility to serve others. Mission of the Department of Architecture: The Mission of the Department is to nurture and develop in the students the latent creative talent through building awareness and knowledge of the arts and sciences of the built form; and the application of the knowledge in a problem solving approach to learning. Its aim is to provide the students with education and experiences that are broadly based on the fundamentals of the profession and are delivered through hands-on learning. Our Core Values & Belief The Department believes in the following core values: Design as Problem Solving Approach to Learning That architecture is experiential in nature and must rely on problem solving approach to learning in design studios to seek ideas as they evolve in an interactive process of imagination. Design as Exploration In exploring creative thinking and working on them to sculpt imaginative solutions in a process that cultivates intellectual curiosity and life-long learning. Design as Problem Solving In achievements that seek solution to real life building and urban problems and celebrate the power of creativity and innovation in service of society. It believes in being grounded in realism to aspire towards the ideal. Design as Aesthetics In celebrating the power of creativity and architecture; and their ability to mould environments that move the mind, give pleasure and fulfill architects’ moral responsibility towards the society;  Design as Culture of Continuity In architectural design that is sensitive to culture, society, economy and physical context in a seamless continuum. Chairman's Message Careers In Architecture Architects are leaders in the building industry. Fresh graduates typically establish themselves as independent practitioners. So far the largest numbers of architecture graduates are working independently with their own practice or under other senior architects. A number of graduates have entered in Government service as assistant architects in organizations such as the Government’s Department of Architecture, City Development Authorities, Municipalities and the various City Corporations. Multi-national companies who maintain their in-house design sections to build and maintain their various offices and sale outlets are also hiring architecture graduates. National and international consulting and construction firms are seeking the services of architects to prepare construction and presentation drawings and supervise their construction projects. Government regulations require property developers to employ full time architects, which, currently is another sector where graduates are finding work. Besides direct architectural practice, a number of graduates are branching off to make a career in regional and infrastructure planning and development, urban and landscape design, facility and construction management, as contractors, property developers or in business and trade, and associating with international aid organizations and NGOs. The growth of a large number of architecture schools in the country has created a need for qualified teachers. A number of our graduates are going abroad to obtain higher degrees and returning home to join teaching. Within the span of just nine years, our graduates have made significant achievements for themselves. Events   NSU Architecture Celebrates Bengali New Year 1420:The students of the Department of Architecture under the banner of the NSU Canvas Club celebrated the Bengali New Year 1420 with their very own Mongol Jatra, a colorful rally of masks and banners to welcome the new year in the spirit of celebration and national pride. Like every year, the club hosted a pre-Boishakh three-day mask making workshop, Karigor, to encourage students to get involved in the preparations for the rally. All papier-mâché masks and sculptures displayed in the rally were handmade by the students of the university. The rally was followed by a daylong cultural program and a gala festival. NSU Students are Going Places Maneka Azalea Faizi, an architecture alumna has completed her Masters from the University of McGill, Canada recently and joined others like Tanita Islam (Columbia University), NabilShahidi (Columbia University), MehreenMahmood (Melbourne University) and Mehbuba Tune Uzra, MasumIqbal, BorhanUddin, Taufiq Ahmed and more (DIA, Germany) in the ranks of NSU Architecture alumni to have graduated from top ranking institutions in Europe, North America and Australia following their Bachelors from NSU. The Departments' tradition of placing talented students for internships at challenging architectural practices at home and abroad encourages their involvement and interest in higher studies and job opportunities abroad. Currently NSU Architecture students are going to top Indian, Sri Lankan and Malaysian Architectural offices for their internship, in addition to working with renowned architects at home.NSU Graduate Mehbuba Wins Prestigious 2012 DAAD Prize for International Students The 2012 Anhalt University awardee of the DAAD Prize for International Students was NSU Department of Architecture graduate Mehbuba Tune Uzra, currently a 2nd year Dessau International Architecture (DIA) Master student at Anhalt University Dessau. The prize is awarded annually to international degree-seeking Master students at Anhalt University with outstanding academic achievements and a convincing track record in extra-curricular activities. Both holds more than true for Ms Tune Uzra.With a B. ARCH.from North South University, she is very much aware of the challenges life poses to international students in Germany and Dessau. Prof Johannes Kalvelage of Anhalt University’s DIA introduced the audience of international and German students as well as lecturers and staff to the prize and praised the committed work of students and awardees alike with very warm words.NSU Architecture Alumni graduate from Top Universities abroad \"Architecture happened to me by luck. Till my A-Levels I had no idea that such subject existed. I started class in Economics but it was the head of the Architecture Department at that time who persuaded me to study Architecture. From then onwards, there was no turning back. With time, Architecture became a lifestyle rather than a subject. It became a passion rather than a mundane learning process. I graduated from NSU, practiced Architecture for a year and a half but the fervor to learn more about the subject never died. And this is how my quest for higher studies began. I got selected to do my Master of Architecture in one of world's top 17th University - the McGill University; also referred to as Canada's Harvard.\" - Maneka Azalea FaiziAbrarRahman goes to Team Architrave, Colombo, Sri Lanka for Internship \"Team Architrave is a homely but prominent architectural practice in the heart of Colombo, Sri Lanka led by its principal Architect MadhuraPrematilleke. Team Architrave is the firm I spent the last three months trying to learn the tricks of the trade. What I think separates this firm from any other I have ever seen is the \"Team\" in front of its name. Every person working here is treated with the same amount of importance and every member acts as an integral part of a perfectly running machine. The office environment is a perfect mixture of fun and work. Any other can never replace the experience I got from this internship. My experience has changed my views about architecture and practicing architects if not anything else. I understood architects are responsible for more than just designing a building, that there are more to architecture practice than making good looking buildings. This realization came working at the office where every aspect, from a doorknob to the appliances to be used, for the design project is tended. As interns we had to make working drawings, council drawings, 3D visualizations, make and review bills, make project hand over papers and building user manuals for clients, site visits and snagging reports, etc. It was a life changing experience to say the least.\" - AbrarRahman, fifth year student NSU Department of ArchitectureM.M. MeshkathMollah, internship at SN Low & Associates, KL, Malaysia \"SN Low & Associates SdnBhd was established since 1987 with offices in Malaysia and associate offices in China, Dubai, India, Hong Kong and Vietnam. Their underlying philosophy is to create and deliver creative yet functional architectural designs and dynamics to add value to clients' expectations on project in today's ever changing challenging environment. I had an opportunity to join as a visiting architectural trainee in SN Low & Associates in late 2012. After working with their experienced professionals, I learned about the creative and functional space and with using them in a contemporary way in the sector of architecture and urban design. In this short time period, I was working in residential, commercial, institutional, housing, corporate office-cum-warehouse facilities, retail malls and mixed development projects. All these working experiences have inspired me a lot.\" - Meshkath Hossain Mollah, fifth year student NSU Department of ArchitectureNSU Architecture at the ARCASIA Student Jamboree, Bali NSU Architecture students were active delegates at the ARCASIA (Architects Regional Council of Asia) Student Jamboree held in Denpasar, Bali Indonesia from 28th October to 2nd November 2012. Approximately 250 students from 14 Nations of Asia participated in the event and NSU students stood out in their performance in various events in the 5 day program, achieving 3rd prize in cultural performance and 1st and 2nd prizes in Bamboo bale construction. NSU students were members in two of the groups that were the fastest in assembling a bamboo kiosk to secure their leading positions in the competition.   People Highly qualified faculty members who have a minimum of first class in all studies and at least a master's degree from reputed North American, European and equivalent institutions lead North South University Department of Architecture. Perhaps, we are the only university in the country to maintain this as a standard in faculty qualification.  Our teachers promote a positive attitude among students in developing self-reliance. They encourage respect to time management, democratic decision-making and diverse ideas. Award winning and internationally reputed architects and media personalities, art critics, artists, sculptors, filmmakers, interior, fashion and textile designers and product designers are regularly invited to lecture at the school. Such interaction enriches the quality, knowledge and experience of the students. Architecture is both a professional and a creative discipline, so we believe strongly in integrating practical knowledge with theory in the design studios. We regularly invite renowned architects and allied professionals to team up with core teachers to provide input in design studios. The total teaching family the students are exposed to in the five years of their study are core members, part-time teachers and guest speakers all of whom have one thing in common- the dedication and enthusiasm to go beyond the ordinary learning of architecture into an arena of critical academic exchange and enrichment.

At NSU, the undergraduate architecture education is comprised of a five-year Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) program. The program prepares students for professional practice in architecture. Students are educated on the basic principles of architecture and the precedents that have influenced those principles. Established in 2005, the curriculum is approved by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and accredited by the Institute of Architects Bangladesh (IAB). It is closely based on the North American educational system for Architects and aligned with the structure of the commonly accredited professional programs by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) of USA, the Canadian Architectural Certification Board (CCAB-CCCA) of Canada and the educational requirements for licensing and certification by the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) of USA. It satisfies fully the requirements for Architectural education guidelines set by the United Nation’s Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Commonwealth Association of Architects (CAA), the International Union of Architects (UIA) and the Architects Regional Council Asia (ARCASIA). The curriculum is the third registered program recognized by the Supreme Education Council of Qatar, under Qatar’s Urban Planning and Development Authority (UPDA) - Engineering Committee. It is a five-year (fifteen-semester) program of 170 credit hours. The first four-years of the degree program are faculty driven and stress on the education of the individual and serves as the foundation for advanced study in the discipline. The final year studio involves the design of a building in depth. The studio consists of a student-initiated final project, which has been identified, researched, and programmed mostly by the student with general parameters set by the faculty. Required and elective professional courses in practice, history and theory, architectural technologies, urbanism, energy studies and environmental systems complement the education of the architect in the studios. To become a licensed architect in Bangladesh, the primary requirement is an accredited five-year B.Arch degree. The remaining requirements for licensure are a minimum period of two years of professional training under an architect and a passing score on the Oral Examination or Architectural Registration Examination administered by the Institute of Architects Bangladesh (IAB). IAB full members are registered with the Rajdhani Unnayan Katripakhkha (RAJUK) or the various municipalities in the district towns, to practice as licensed architects.  Curriculum The courses in architecture are divided into six broad based areas: 1.

How to maintain Financial Aid at NSU? Once awarded, a student must demonstrate satisfactory academic progress in order to maintain tuition waiver and other forms of financial aid at NSU. General aid recipients must maintain a minimum CGPA of 2.75 and 100% financial aid recipients must maintain a minimum CGPA of 3.25 or above. Students, whose financial aid has been discontinued due to failure to maintain minimum academic performance, may reapply for aid as a fresh applicant. Financial aid is automatically renewed if a student continues to fulfill the aid criteria. However, the recipients/awardees must contact the financial aid office every semester during the advising/registration process and submit their advised-sheet for necessary verification and adjustment of tuition waiver from the NSU Accounts Office. The financial aid office reviews and verifies the academic performance of aid recipients every semester against the aid criteria. Continuing recipients of financial aid and tuition waiver can also apply for enhancement of their waiver amounts. When to apply for Financial Aid and how? Applications for financial aid are invited from bona fide students of NSU every Spring and Summer semesters. Students seeking financial aid are required to apply for the same in a prescribed Application Form available at Prime Bank Ltd. Bashundhara Branch, Dhaka upon a payment of Tk. 1,000/= (one thousand) only. No applications are accepted in Fall semester. Financial Aid applicants are required to submit the duly filled out Application Form and all supporting documents to the Financial Aid Office of the University within the deadlines as below: Financial Aid Calendar Spring Semester (January to April): Applications are invited in 1st Week of January Summer Semester (May to August): Applications are invited in 1st Week of May   Financial Aid Policies & Guidelines Students must score a minimum CGPA of 2.75 in their undergraduate studies to apply for and maintain financial aid. Undergraduate students must complete minimum 09 credit hours, not counting non-credit courses, to apply for financial assistance. To maintain financial aid, recipients must register for at least 24 (Twenty four) credits in a year with effect from the semester of receiving financial assistance. Financial aid applicants must apply in prescribed form along with necessary papers/ documents as applicable. They must be accompanied by their parent(s) or local guardian(s) or representative(s) of the parents during an interview. From the date financial aid is awarded, a maximum of 16 (sixteen) semesters are allotted for maintaining financial aid and tuition waiver for Bachelor of Architecture students. Semester(s) withdrawn by a student within this period are still counted and aid is not extended in any way beyond this approved period. Financial aid is discontinued with immediate effect if an awarded student is delinquent in any way or if CGPA falls below 2.75 for partial aid recipients, and 3.25 for full aid recipients. Financial aid is automatically discontinued for unauthorized absence in any semester; however, the revival of such assistance is considered in due course upon the receipt of fresh applications from the student. Financial aid is not extended to courses retaken for improvement of grade. Aid recipients must make full payments on their own for courses retaken. Wards of freedom fighters are required to register for at least 27 credits in a year with effect from the semester of their receiving the financial assistance and must maintain a CGPA of 2.75 in their undergraduate studies.

I chose Architecture so that I can contribute in my country and other Asian countries for economic development. To achieve my goals, my parents always encouraged travelling at home and abroad to see the historical places of interest, understand the beauties of modern architecture and take photography for reference. After graduating with a Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) with honors from North South University in 2011, I started my career in Qatar and my NSU credentials were accepted by the Supreme Education Council (SEC). Having work experience of more than 2 years, I got accredited as a Registered Architect under Qatar’s Urban Planning and Development Authority (UPDA) - Engineering Committee. Working in the field, I got the opportunity to join “Concept Middle East” conference where I acknowledged the way of design in the Middle East, particularly sustainable issues such as day lighting, recycling and current & future trends in the Middle Eastern construction industry. My experience in the Department of Architecture (NSU) was so excellent and tremendously positive, only because of the supportive and continuous guidance and educational environment there. The NSU Administration always values its students and actively seeks our continued feedback. The extent of knowledge, experience and deliberation in the class of different professors was particularly useful for drawing my interests in this field. My fellow as well as students of the faculty have been extremely passionate, very nice and sincere. The studios in the faculty became my home. My goal, right now is to gain exposure of various types of project scales, their phases and sustainability issues, which in the future will help me become a LEED accredited professional.                                                                                                Tanita Choudhury \"After receiving my Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) with honors (Cum Laude) from North South University in 2010, I was enrolled in the MS. Advanced Architectural Design Program in the Graduation School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP), Columbia University. During my study at Columbia University, I had the privilege to conduct research under Kenneth Frampton, present my design projects to 27 Department of Architecture website-acclaimed architects such as Kengo Kuma, Diana Agrest and Bernard Tschumi. I also had the opportunity to travel from my University to Sendai and Tokyo, Japan to take part in Toyo Ito's 'Home for All' project where I met Toyo Ito and Kazuyo Sejima and presented my project on 3/11 Natural Disaster tragedy to the students of University of Tokyo with Kuma as a head juror. I also had the opportunity to meet Steven Holl, Denise Scott Brown, Bjarke Ingels and Peter Eisenman through various lectures and events in my university and the city. My project was selected and published in GSAPP's prestigious annual publication “Abstract”. My experience in my alma maters had been contrasting yet very fulfilling as North South University helped me understand the significance of sensitivity and austerity in design while Columbia University triggered me to question and reinvent the wheel of design through its emphasis on experimentation. I am currently working as a designer at Gensler San Francisco Headquarters in USA.\" – Tanita Choudhury Nabil Shahidi I received my Bachelor of Architecture degree (B.Arch) from NSU in 2010 and worked in Dhaka for about 3 years for various firms. I also setup my own practice called ONNO Architects with two of my friends also from NSU and we worked on various projects ranging from prototype wall panel development to apartment design in Dhaka to eco-resorts in Bandarban. I also participated in various competitions and in collaboration with the firm A+AA, won the 1st prize in the competition to design a 34 Acre campus master plan for Hamdard University of Bangladesh. In 2013 I enrolled in the MS. Advanced Architectural Design Program in the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP) at Columbia University in New York. During my time there, I had the privilege to study under acclaimed professors such as Kenneth Frampton, Yehuda Safran, and Enrique Walker. I also had the opportunity to meet and learn from Steven Holl, Bernard Tschumi, Peter Eisenman, Jacques Herzog, Richard Meier, Alberto Campo Baeza, Rahul Mehrotra, Mohsen Mostafavi, Alejandro Zaera-Polo, Bjarke Ingels, David Adjaye and Sou Fujimoto through various lectures and events in my university and the city. I also got to travel from my GSAPP to Amman, Paris, Basel, Zurich, Basel, and Bregenz as part of design studio research.  My project was selected to be published in GSAPP's prestigious annual publication “Abstract”. I am very grateful for all my experiences at NSU Dept. Architecture, as it helped me to build a strong foundation for myself. – Nabil Shahidi M Tawfique Rahman I shifted from Dhaka University applied physics to North South University architecture, because architecture has been a passion. In my 4th year, I went to renowned a firm at Ahmedabad, India, HCPDPM for internship. There I had the opportunity to work with Bimal Patel and come in contact with Hashmukh Patel and B.V Doshi. After completing B.Arch. from NSU, I went to Hochschule Anhalt, Germany for my masters. During my masters, my semester projects had been selected by the Anhalt School as entry for Xella Student Competition 2011 and Wolfsburg City Competition- 2012. My second semester project was displayed at Wolfsburg Rathhous from May 17-20, 2013. My thesis project “Creating Infrastructure, Creating Values”, was awarded as the honorable mention of best thesis project for Robert-Oxman Prize 2013 and was published in the magazine “DIA news”. During my study in Europe I had the opportunity to travel to different schools and countries, and came in contact with Daniel Libskind , Remkoolhas, Jaha Hadeed, Peter Eisenmen in different workshops and seminars. I also had the opportunity to represent my work as team leader on seminars- “infrastructure urbanism” and “climatic response” at Dessau institute of architecture having Prof. Andrea Hasse and Prof. Gunnar Hartman as the head juror. I conducted my thesis project under Prof. Andrea Hasse , Prof. Lurs Lerup and Prof. Ralf Neibergal. NSU has helped me create the base of understanding architecture, HCPDPM helped taught me the real life scenarios and Hochschule Anhalt helped me to find my own expression of architecture. Currently I am working as a part time architect at URBANA/ Kashef Mahboob Choudhury and full time lecturer at South-East University.- M Tawfique Rahman. Sadia Raquib With my determination for undergraduate studies in Architecture, I got myself admitted in the North South University, the first private university in Bangladesh. After graduating with a Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) with honors from North South University in 2011, I started my career in Qatar and the Supreme Education Council (SEC) has accredited my degree program from NSU. Having earned experience of more than 2 years, I got accepted as a Registered Architect under Qatar’s Urban Planning and Development Authority (UPDA) - Engineering Committee. Working in the field of architecture, I had the opportunity to join “Concept Middle East” conference where I acknowledged the way of design in Middle East, sustainable issues, day lighting, recycling efforts and current & future trends in Middle East construction industry. My experience in the Department of Architecture (NSU) was excellent and tremendously positive, because of a supportive, continuously guiding and excellent educational environment. My goal, right now is to gain exposure to various types of projects of larger scales, their various phases and the sustainable issues which will help me to become a LEED accredited professional. Ahsan Feroz When I was purchasing the admission form from the registrar’s office at NSU, a desk officer passed me a leaflet on “NSU Architecture”, a department that was very new then. I felt like there must be something exciting in it than other subjects. I placed “Architecture” in my choice list and the five years journey at NSU was simply amazing.Towards the later part of my academic career, I was travelling with a friend and we were crossing the Hatirjheel area and learned that the consulting firm was looking for architects for this project. After graduating a few months later, I knocked the door of Vitti  Sthapati Brindo Ltd. for a job and started to work there. Soon I was posted as the project coordinator of “Rehabilitation of Old Modhumoti River Project (ROMRP)”. My professional life was 50% design works and 50% of coordination with other parties such as the engineering consultants and the client i.e. the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED). In August 2010, I enrolled in the Master’s in Disaster Management Program in BRAC University and acquired the Vice Chancellors Medal for academic performance in the course. In early 2012, I took a break from architecture and joined the UNDP Bangladesh for a while in the research fields. Later that year I switched to BRAC, where I was working as a consultant for innovations in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) cluster. In parallel to WASH innovations, I was also doing WASH communications and innovations for Disaster Environment and Climate Change (DECC) cluster of BRAC. In January 2013, I was invited to join a project consultant team at LGED. In March 2013, I joined City Region Development Project (CRDP) of LGED, where I am still working. Currently I am working as the Architecture and Planning Coordinator at CRDP. Mehbuba Tune UzraMehbuba Tune Uzra graduated from NSU Department of Architecture and enrolled in the Masters Program at the Anhalt University in Dessau, Germany. In 2012 she won the prestigious DAAD Prize for International Students during her 2nd year at the Dessau International Architecture (DIA) Master studentship. The prize is awarded annually to international degree-seeking Master students at Anhalt University with outstanding academic achievements and a convincing track record in extra-curricular activities. Prof Johannes Kalvelage of Anhalt University’s DIA praised the committed work of students and awardees alike with very warm words. Mehbuba completed her studies and returned to Bangladesh and established her own architectural practice in Dhaka. Visit NSU Architecture Alumni Association facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/groups/630853236980751/ Reference Library Department of Architecture, Reference Library We encourage research-based learning and our theory and studio courses are tailored to provide emphasis on learning through hands-on investigation.  We supplement our basic CAD and manual drawing courses with a field survey component that includes visit to buildings of historic importance, to carry out measurements and photographic surveys that are used to produce measured drawings and research on the buildings’ architectural and historic significance. Our courses on design theory emphasize field visit to local architectural firms and to conduct interviews with renowned practicing architects to gain first hand knowledge through participation rather than depending on secondary  sources.  Our  building  systems  courses  include  hands  on  construction  of small-scale floor, wall and structural elements and visits to real building sites to learn hands on about building structure, construction techniques and mechanical systems. Experienced leading electro-mechanical professionals are typically invited as guest teachers to conduct these courses. Carpentry Workshop A part of the NSU Carpentry Workshop Carpentry and Metal Workshop North South University, Department of Architecture is perhaps the only architecture school in the country to have its own carpentry workshop and limited metal works machinery to provide the students with the opportunity to build their own models with wood and metal. It has a state-of-the-art computer laboratory where high-end software trainings are given as a part of the regular architecture curriculum. Reference Library In  addition  to  a  wealth  of online  journals,  audio-visual  materials  and  books  in  the central library, the department maintains its own reference library, rich with collections of the latest books, journals, audio-visual materials and a small materials collection to facilitate research and learning by the students and the faculty. Green Building Research Lab It is also the first architecture department in the country to receive a grant from the UGC  under  the  Higher  Education  Quality  Enhancement  Project  (HEQEP)  under  the World Bank’s financial support to develop a green and sustainable building design research lab. This building technology & material research lab is equipped with data loggers, building skin performance measurement equipment, its own weather station, wind tunnel and building performance simulation software that enables the students to conduct research on the latest green building systems as part of the curriculum on design. Energy modeling and performance based design is an emphasis area, where students are taught by carrying out field investigation of building performance with data loggers and virtual simulation tools to inform design. These are leading architectural design research in the field. Computer Laboratory BTMRL Lab Contact SAC   \n"

Program Department of Mathematics and Physics (DMP), North South University (NSU), celebrated the pi-moment of the century at the campus. Pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. It is symbolized by the greek letter pi in the lower case (π). This is a fixed quantity, which is usually taken to be 3.14. The number of digits after the decimal is infinite. In the western countries, especially in the US, March 14 (written 3/14 in the American style) is celebrated every year as the pi-day. March 14 this year is a bit more special. The first ten digits of the value of pi, i.e., 3.141592653 can be arranged as March 14, 15, 9:26:53. We call this special moment as the pi-moment. This moment will come again in 2115, one hundred years later. At this precise moment (according to Bangladesh-time) of this century, students from various departments of NSU participated in a celebration of the moment. They formed a human circle with a diameter. Then dividing the number of people in the circumference by the number of people in the diameter yielded a value close to the actual value of pi. They did the same thing with chairs. At the end a large number of people formed the shape of the symbol π.   Professor Partha Pratim Dey, the chairman of the Department was present at the event along with a few other faculty members, namely, Kazi Abu Sayeed, Hasina Akter, and Muhammad Asad-uz-zaman. A few part time faculty members were present as well as Golam Dastegir Al Quaderi, a faculty member of the Physics Department at Dhaka University, who participated as a guest. The initiative was taken by Naureen Ahsan, a part time faculty member at NSU and a full time faculty member at Dhaka University.  Pi-moment of the century, March 14, 15  9:26:53Chairman of DMP is seen with faculty members and students.           The human circle yielded a close value to pi  A chair circle yielded an even closer value to pi A human pi symbol       Celebration of International Day of Mathematics 2023   Faculty Staff & Administration Nahid Sanjana  Designation: Program Officer Phone Number: +88 02 55668200, Ext: 1561 E-mail: nahid.sanjana@northsouth.edu Office Room:  SAC1038 Office Hours: Sunday to Thursday: 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM   Farjana Abedin Designation: Department Secretary Phone Number: +88 02 55668200, Ext: 1560 Email: Office  Room: SAC 1037 Office Hours: Sunday to Thursday: 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM     Md.

Message from the Chairman     The Department of Mathematics and Physics is one of the dynamic departments of North South University, which incorporates fundamental, experimental and mathematical study. We are committed to excellence in teaching and research. At present the department does not offer any major program, but it offers the mathematics and physics courses for all undergraduate students of different disciplines across the university.  The department runs a 21 credit Mathematics minor and a 15 credit Physics minor to attract the most talented Engineering, Economics, and Business and Environmental sciences majors.   The strength of the department is grounded not only in the transmission of ideas and knowledge through quality teaching, but also in the cutting-edge research and scholarly achievements of our faculty members. Fifteen of our twenty four full-time faculty members are Ph.D. s from North America, Australia or Western Europe. The breadth of expertise of our faculty members covers almost the entire range of mathematics and physics, pure as well as applied. They are active in developing new ideas and results exploring the latest knowledge of mathematics and physics with modern computation skills profound to solve problems in the engineering and computational sciences, physical and biological sciences, economics and business. The Department of Mathematics and Physics is located on the 10th floor of the SAC building of NSU. Currently we have  full-time and part-time faculty members in our department. The part-time faculty members are from among the best faculty members of the reputed universities in Dhaka like Dhaka University, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology etc. We have a plan to transform our department from present service position to a full-fledged Department of Mathematical Sciences, which among other things will offer a major in mathematics as well as a major in Physics. I believe, given our faculty strength, this transformation should be a piece of cake. Professor & ChairmanDepartment of Mathematics and Physics (DMP) Seminar Departement of Mathematics and Physics has been organizing Biweekly Colloquium since 2015. Every semester we invite two speakers from home and abroad to present their current research works. The aim of this Colloquium is to extend research collaborations amoung the faculty members and students with other Departmets of NSU and other Universities of the country.  If you are interested to present your research works please contact via email : monir.uddin@northsouth.edu   37th Biweekly Colloquium, Date and Time: 15/12/2022 at 1:30 pm Speaker:  Dr. Zaid Bin Mahabub. Associate Professor, Department of Mathematics and Physics, NSU Title: Prediction of Conduction Velocity Distribution of Motor Nerve Fibers from Compound Muscle Action Potential Abstract: Prediction of motor nerve conduction velocity distribution (CVD) from compound muscle action potential (CMAP), also known as the inverse problem of nerve conduction, is one of the effective tools for assessing the peripheral neuropathies by evaluating the electrophysiological characteristics of the peripheral nerves. Recent studies have utilized a continuous approach to solve the inverse problem exploiting the least square method. We assume that different metaheuristic algorithms could be utilized to solve not only the inverse problem of nerve conduction, but also predict the motor unit action potential (MUAP) signal. We have utilized a piecewise Hermite polynomial function to design the MUAP waveform and a modified single Weibull function to model the CVD of human median nerves. Our new framework produced the optimal parameter values that produce the predicted CVD and MUAP which result in generating a CMAP signal that closely correlates the corresponding collected CMAP signal. The inverse approach presented in this study may provide an effective non-invasive alternative tool to deal with this ill-conditioned inverse problem of motor nerve conduction.   36th Biweekly Colloquium, Date and Time: 10/11/2022 at 11:30 am Speaker: Dr. Mohammad Osman Gani, Professor, Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh Title: Bifurcation Analysis of Periodic Traveling Wave Solutions in Excitable Reaction-Diffusion Systems Abstract: In this talk, I will show the existence and stability of periodic traveling waves (PTWs) in two- variable excitable reaction-diffusion systems. We introduce a system of reaction-diffusion equations to mimic the excitability of cardiac cells. Our results show two types of bifurcations in the periodic traveling waves. The Eckhaus and Hopf bifurcations are two basic bifurcations in the PTWs. There are two families of PTWs: fast and slow. The first one is stable in the case of the standard FitzHugh-Nagumo excitable system. However, we observe that it becomes unstable in our model and bifurcates to an oscillating wave. We explain this phenomenon by numerically calculating the essential spectra of the periodic traveling waves. In addition, the standard FitzHugh-Nagumo model cannot capture the irregular action potentials of sufficiently large periods in a one-parameter family of solutions. Motivated by this, we propose a modified FitzHugh-Nagumo reaction-diffusion system by changing its recovery kinetics. We find that the PTWs of sufficiently large periods cross the stability boundary. Moreover, we observe a reasonable agreement between the direct PDE simulations and the solutions in the traveling wave ODEs. In two dimensions, we study the spiral wave instability that agrees with the waves observed in cellular activity.     35th Biweekly Colloquium, Date and Time: 07/07/2022 at 2:40 pm Speaker: Dr. Mohammad Ferdows, Professor, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh Title: Impact of Hemodynamic Properties in Coronary Main Artery Disease Based on Biomedical Imaging Abstract:  A conventional invasive catheterization procedure is currently used to detect atherosclerotic severity in coronary arteries. However, it is still challenging to measure multiple consecutive stenoses (MCS) in coronary main arteries, a severe condition, by using the invasive method. In this paper, we report important haemodynamic properties like the wall shear stress (WSS) and velocity magnitude across different luminal areas of coronary stenosis in patient-based right coronary artery models of MCS using pulsatile heart flow simulations. The WSS and velocity magnitudes in blood flow simulations of different degrees of stenosis indicated a relationship between the proximal moderate stenosis and the distal severe stenosis models. We have adopted open-source tools for different stages of this computational method. The results show the physical effects of different haemodynamic factors including velocity magnitude, mean arterial pressure difference, WSS and virtual fractional flow reserve (vFFR), which allow for predicting the physiological computation in the MCS models conditions. This study identifies fundamental physics critical for haemodynamic function and indicates the impact of these factors on vFFR measurements. These findings provide insight into and improvement of the pathophysiological assessment of MCS. The results reveal haemodynamic properties which can be used to diagnose coronary irregularities using a visualization method. 34th Biweekly Colloquium, Date and Time: 02/06/2022 at 2:40 pm Speaker: Afroja Parvin, Lecturer, DMP, NSU Title: Interaction of Ocean waves in a multi-layer shallow water system with topography Abstract: Mathematical modeling of ocean waves is based on the formulation and solution of the appropriate equations of continuity, momentum, and the choice of proper initial and boundary conditions. Many free surface water waves can be approximated by using the shallow water equations (SWE) under the influence of gravity, with the assumption that the wave's horizontal length scale is considerably bigger than the depth scale and the wave height is much less than the fluid's mean depth. Furthermore, the three-dimensional flows in hydrostatic and Boussinesq limits can be described by the multi-layer shallow water equation, in which the fluid is discretized horizontally into a set of vertical layers, each with its own height, density, horizontal velocity, and geopotential. This work presents a two-dimensional version of DYNAMICO method and compares it with one-dimensional SWE. The equations are discretized using a Lagrangian vertical coordinate system which does not allow the mass to flow across the vertical layers. An explicit staggered finite volume method has been used to solve the single and multi-layer SWE, with and without density stratification and topography. The Lagrangian vertical grid is remapped using an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) algorithm onto the initial σ-z based coordinates as necessary. A low-storage explicit fourth-order Runge–Kutta scheme is used for time integration. The phase speed and wave characteristics of multi-layer SWE surface waves with and without density stratification are compared to those of single-layer SWE surface waves. In addition, the model is validated by comparing the numerical results with the analytical solutions of linearized two-layer SWE. The result confirms the accuracy of the model. A series of numerical experiments are presented to explain the dynamics and interactions between the surface waves and internal waves of the Ocean.     33rd Biweekly Colloquium, Date and Time: 03/03/2022 at 2:00 pm Speaker: Dr. Mohammad Ali Nawaz, Assistant Professor, DMP Title: The role of Galactic Dynamics on Star Formation.   Abstract: The Milky Way, our cosmic residence,    is one of the most studied yet enigmatic celestial structures.    To understand the formation and evolution of the Galaxy,    we require detailed knowledge of the star formation process.    To this end, we studied a large sample of 500 star-forming    dense molecular clumps near the Galactic center, focussing     on a detail understanding of the role of large scale Galactic    dynamics on star formation. We obtain that the spectral and    physical characteristics of these clumps are strongly coupled with the Galactic dynamics, for instance, i) three clump    clusters near the Galactic center are affected by the Galactic    bar shock, resulting in their emission line broadening,    ii) high mass clumps are mostly located on the Galactic    spiral arms, which may be attributed to an impact of   spiral density waves, and iii) low mass clumps are    ubiquitous on the Galactic plane. In addition, based    on the outcomes obtained from spectral analysis,    we developed a supervised convolutional neural    network that classifies the star forming clumps with 90% accuracy. Currently,    we are developing an unsupervised machine learning architecture, a self organising map,    to classify molecular clumps based on their spectral distributions on the sky.      31st Biweekly Colloquium: 15th July , 2021 Title: Time delay coordinates for Dynamic Mode Decomposition. Speaker: Dr. Shariful Islam, Assiatent Professor, Dept. of Mathematics and Physics, North South University. Abstract:  Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is a data-driven modeling technique used toextract dynamic features in a complex physical system from time-series data. We review thealgorithm and establish its connection to the Koopman operator and Proper OrthogonalDecomposition. The performance of DMD depends on factors like the nature of the data, size ofthe data, and noise present in the data. In this talk, I will show how time delay coordinates havebeen used as a modification in the DMD algorithm to deal with data that has a highly oscillatoryflow and then demonstrate the method on data acquired from a compressible signal. This versionof DMD perfectly captures the dynamics and results in a reliable model for future prediction.          Text16 News Events Events   Celebration of the  \"International Day of  Mathematics\" 2023                                                        The Department of Mathematics & Physics (DMP) will celebrate the \"International Day of Mathematics\" on 20th March 2023. This year the  International Mathematical Union has recognized NSU as an Event Partner of the  International Day of Mathematics (IDM)  celebration 2023. The DMP has taken different initiatives focusing on the applications of mathematics studies in different branches of science and engineering, including rally, contest and discusion sessions.

Chairman's Message The Department of English & Modern Languages offers graduate and undergraduate programs in English which give students an opportunity to know and appreciate the science of language as well as the literary works of English and to develop literary and linguistic aptitudes of their own. The Bachelor of Arts (BA) and the Master of Arts (MA) programs in English are divided into three lines of specialization: TESOL, Linguistics, and Literature. The degrees are recommended for students interested in a strong background in the humanities with a concentration on language and literature. The degrees also enable the graduate to pursue careers in the academic as well as the non-academic world. The freshmen and the sophomores get an opportunity to do interdisciplinary courses to enable themselves to get a wide range of general education. By the third year, they have an option to major in one or two of the above mentioned three streams i.e. Linguistics, Teaching English to Speakers of Other Language (TESOL), and Literature. Thus, they not only get a variety of options to choose from, but also equip themselves with essential skills in specialized areas. Currently, almost 85% of the undergraduate students are majoring in linguistics in DEML, while nearly 95% of the graduate students opted for TESOL. The department includes faculty members who have a broad range of professional competence in literature and language, and who are trained to teach courses in language study, linguistics, translation, world cultures, world literature and teaching English as a foreign language. The department also offers a number of foreign language courses for the students of the university as well as for people from outside NSU. Since Spring 2013, the department has offered language development and proficiency programs in the form of intensive courses in seven widely used international languages (English, French, Spanish, German, Japanese, Arabic, and Bangla).  In addition to the foreign language courses, the department also organizes a variety of activities such as the Spectrum Seminars (seminar series), Discourse I and II (lecture series), and language workshops to raise language awareness and generate research interest in language and related issues among the students as well as the faculty members of NSU.   Chairman Ph.D., Jawaharlal Nehru University, India  Staff members Mahboob Rasheed Sr. Officer Email: mahboob.rasheed@northsouth.edu Ext.:2020 Masum Hossain Officer Email: masum.hossain@northsouth.edu Ext.:2012 Ms. Tanjia Azmeen Department Secretary Email: tanjia.azmeen@northsouth.edu Ext.:2021 Joynal Abedin Faculty Assistant Email: joynal.abedin@northsouth.edu Ext.:6145 Contacts Department of English and Modern Languages (DEML) North Academic Building- NAC957 - NAC959 North South University Plot-15, Block - B, Bashundhara, Dhaka-1229, Bangladesh +880-2-55668200, Ext. 2020/2021/2012  |   Fax: +880-2-55668202 Faculty Information Name of the faculty member with specialization in TESOL  Dr. Mohammad Shamsuzzaman Ph.D. in College of Education, University of Canterbury, New Zealand  Dr. Sukanto Roy Ph.D. in Composition & TESOL, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, USA  Dr. Shakila Nur Ph.D. in TESOL, University of Tasmania, Australia  Dr. Shapla Perveen  Ph.D. in ESL, International Islamic University, Malaysia  Ms. Nasreen Rahman MA in TESOL, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, USA  Ms. Sakiba Ferdousy  MA in TESOL, University of Nottingham, UK  Ms. Michelle Draper   MA in TESOL, Nottingham University, UK  Ms. Nausheen Saba Siraj     MEd in TESOL, University of Sydney, Australia  Ms. Shahneela Tasmin Sharmi  MA in TESOL, University of Nottingham, UK  Ms. Ashrafun Nahar  MA in TESOL, University of Huddersfield, UK   Name of the faculty member with specialization in Linguistics  Mr. Mohammed Shahedul Haque MA in English Linguistics, University of Central England, UK  Ms. Farzana Mohsin    MA in Applied Linguistics, University of Bedfordshire, UK  Ms. Nasrin Pervin   MA in Linguistics, Nottingham Trent University, UK  Ms. Musharrat Hossain   MA in English (TESL & Linguistics), Oklahoma State University, USA  Ms. Nasreen Sultana Rahman   M.Phil. in English Language, University of Oslo, Norway  Ms. Sameya Priom (On leave) MA in Psycholinguistics, University of York, UK  Mr. Mehedi Hasan   MA in Applied Linguistics, University of Birmingham, UK  Ms. Tania Rahman   MA in Applied Linguistics, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore   Name of the faculty members with specialization in Literature  Dr. Khaliquzzaman M Elias Ph.D. in English, Howard University, USA  Dr. Shireen Huq Ph.D. in English Literature, Bombay University, India  Dr. Deena P.

(3 credits) Graduate Program objective The Master in Public Policy and Governance (MPPG) aims at providing high quality research based education in public administration and public policy. Students are expected to be able to analyze and understand complex issues of public policy and administration by means of organization theory and theories of public policy. The MPPG Program focuses on current, appropriate, and cutting-edge topics of public policy analysis, new modes of governance including New Public Management, e-Governance, globalization, corruption, environment and sustainable development and local governance in the South-Asian and international settings. One of the major objectives of the program is to analyze policies aimed at poverty reduction programs of NGOs such as micro-credit, government's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) Program, policies concerning environment, health, and education, women empowerment and conscientization, and local democracy. This is achieved largely through theoretically oriented and empirically based research on dynamics of policy making and implementation in formal and complex organizations, and in non-profit and international agencies. How they act and interact to make public choices that influence public life, enhance general welfare, and ensure democratic rights and principles of good governance. The program aims to produce graduates with professional skills to map, analyze, and participate in matters relating to public policy and governance drawing on the forefronts of research, practice, and pedagogy in these fields. Knowledge empowerment and knowledge transfer are facilitated through encouraging faculty members, young professionals and students to participate in research, publish research works, and disseminate findings in order to improve governance and public policy making in their places of work. Others Program Change Management Training Program     The Department of General and Continuing Education (GCE) has launched a training project under UNDP’s Civil Service Change Management Programme which is called: Change Management Training  in collaboration with the Ministry of Establishment of the Government of People’s Republic of Bangladesh. This training program is specially designed to develop a core group in the civil service who will be responsible for implementing change processes in selected areas to ensure pro-poor service delivery and to provide knowledge based leadership in civil service. The Civil Service Change Management Programme (CSCMP) is an initiative of the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) and the UNDP with the aim to provide ‘a toolbox or road map’ for civil service reform in Bangladesh. This public administration reform  program aims at supporting the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh in undertaking strategic, doable and high-leverage initiatives. The Programme is part of a longer ‘tradition’ of public administration reform in Bangladesh (in fact, the reform of the Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) has been on the political agenda since Independence in 1971). The long list of both indigenous and donor-driven reform efforts has significantly influenced the conceptualisation and formulation of the Programme. CSCMP does not intend to design, develop and implement wholesale public administration reform. Instead, its main aim is to put the BCS on the road to change, in line with the essentially incremental and unpredictable nature of change. The Programme devotes ample attention to implementation, more specifically, to the management of the changes. The Programme tries to realise this output through strategic interventions in carefully selected reform areas, in order to create maximum leverage for further reform activities: Component A: Change Management, Human Resources and Performance Management Component B: Capacity Development and Transformation of some selected government institutions Component C: Ethics and Integrity in the civil service The change management strategy for CSCMP will incorporate the lessons taught by system and complexity theory and take a flexible and entrepeneurial approach to change at BCS. It will resist the temptation of planned and controlled change, and focus instead upon assisting the BCS in setting up conductive conditions for change to emerge, evolve and consolidate, with an emphasis on the development of the capacity of the organization to learn, adapt and change. Additionally, CSCMP will encourage, stimulate and facilitate building relationships with other actors in the system, while at the same time encourage those actors to become engaged in the change process at the BCS. Program Partnership North-South Partnership of the Program MPPG program is a joint program of the Department of General and Continuing Education, NSU, and the Department of Administration and Organization Theory, University of Bergen, Norway with partnership with the Central Department of Public Administration Tribhuvan University, Nepal. The MPPG program, the one of its kind in South Asia, aims to attract students from the South Asian region. Norwegian students from the faculty of social sciences at University of Bergen are encouraged to take part of their studies in Bangladesh. The North-South University has competent members of the faculty and a very congenial academic atmosphere for knowledge production and dissemination. In this regard, the MPPG Program with relevant courses within the fields of social science will be attractive to Norwegian students. Furthermore, the Department of Administration and Organization Theory at University of Bergen admits 5-8 students from South Asia (mainly from Bangladesh and Nepal) every year under the Quota Scholarship program and the erstwhile Norad Fellowship Program (NFP). In the future, a sandwich program will be established between Bergen and NSU to allow new quota students to take certain courses at NSU to prepare them for better utilization of their academic and scholarly activities in Bergen. The MPPG Program may admit quota students from this region to make full use of the MPPG Program at North-South University. Our Partner Institutions       The Master in Public Policy and Governance (MPPG) Program under the Department of General and Continuing Education at North South University has partnership with the University of Bergen in Norway, Tribhuvan University in Nepal and University of Peradeniya in Sri Lanka. Initially it was a tripartite contract by the Norwegian Centre for International Cooperation in Higher Education (SIU) with the University of Bergen, Norway (main partner institution in North) and North South University, Bangladesh (main partner institution in South). Tribhuvan University in Nepal joined the project as “other partnering institution” at the onset of the project launching and University of Peradeniya in Sri Lanka joined the group at the end of 2008 as a beneficiary in the South-South partnership under the project. The main partnering institution of the MPPG Program under the NOMA (Norad’s Master Studies Program) funding of the tripartite contract is the Department of Administration and Organization Theory of the University of Bergen (UiB) in Norway. Dr. Ishtiaq Jamil, Associate Professor of the Department of Administration and Organization Theory is the Project Coordinator of the NOMA-MPPG project in Norway. UiB mainly looks after the overall management of the project and supports technically. Department of Administration and Organization Theory, University of Bergen, Norway UiB is Norway's urban university who is intricately woven into the geographical, historical and cultural framework of the city, with 14,500 students and 3,200 faculty and staff. The University of Bergen is constantly interfacing with the international environment in order to expand its borders and to explore the world. It is heavily involved in international co-operation in research and education. The university has signed bilateral agreements with universities, research institutions and academic centers of excellence in all parts of the world. UiB is also committed to co-operating with developing countries and has established programs with universities in Third World Countries in the areas of health, poverty, and resource management. And, the NOMA-MPPG Program is one of those promising international effort for development cooperation. The partnering department at UiB was established in 1980, emerged as an independent department. In 1985 the Department adopted its present name: \"The Department of Public Administration and Organization Theory\" The field of study is aimed at familiarizing students with classical problems in political science and political theory such as: the relationship between state and society; organization and individual; professionalization; the division of responsibility between the public and private sectors; democratization; the nature of politics; the relation between politics and administration; conditions for governance; leadership, steering, and management; what are characteristic features of different systems of governance and their normative foundations; ethical issues; and what the relationship is between the values to be realized and the systems of governance that are employed. The field of study is directed to the clarification of how different organizational forms affect the content of decisions, how they are implemented, and what the consequences are. The Department fully recognizes the importance of seeking to broaden the basis of knowledge through research and to lay the foundation for the recruitment of new researchers. Such knowledge is also a necessary prerequisite for the emergence of a group of professionals who possess the academic qualifications required to address and handle problems in society related to administration and organization. The Central Department of Public Administration, Tribhuvan University, Nepal The Central Department of Public Administration under the Faculty of Management at Tribhuvan University is the other partner of the NOMA-MPPG program in South. Dr. Tek Nath Dhakal, Associate Professor of the department at the university is the NOMA Project Coordinator in Nepal. A total of 10 students had been selected from Nepal is two batches (6 students in 2008 intake and 4 students in 2009 intake) through the partner institution for the master degree program (MPPG program). Set up in 1959, Tribhuvan University (TU) is a pioneering institution of higher education in Nepal. Named after the late King Tribhuvan, TU is situated in Kirtipur, a small ancient town located five kilometers away from downtown Kathmandu. Tribhuvan University, a non-profit autonomous institution, is financed mainly by the Government of Nepal. During its 49 years long journey, the state owned university has expanded its programs in different disciplines. There are five technical institutes and four general faculties, which offer 300 courses at certificate, 1079 courses at bachelors and 1000 courses at master levels. Currently, the total courses offered by the university number more than 2400. Both technical institutes and general faculties offer Ph.D. programs in different disciplines. Prior to 1980, TU offered the courses through its constituent campuses only. With the increasing number of students interested in joining the Tribhuvan University, there was a necessity of establishing colleges in the private sector because the constituent campuses of the university alone could not cater to the demand of the nation. So from 1979-80 onward TU started providing affiliation to private colleges to conduct various programs at different levels. 561 private colleges, spread all over the country, have so far received TU affiliations. In the academic session (2008-09) there are altogether 2,90,833 students enrolled at the various levels of TU academic programs. The majority of the students (71,592) belongs to its 60 constituent campuses and 37 central departments while the remaining (1, 19,241) study at the 561 affiliated colleges. It shows that population of students in constituent campuses is very high. This is because of the low tuition fees and easy access. Tribhuvan University has 7,049 teaching faculty members and 5607 non-teaching staffs including support staff in its constituent campuses. The Faculty of Management (FOM) has its ultimate objective of educating students for professional pursuits in business, industry and government. It is further dedicated to contributing to enhance the knowledge and understanding of business and administration. With these aims, the Central Department of Public Administration under this faculty offers Master of Public Administration (MPA) and M.Phil along with Bachelor of Business Studies (BBS), Bachelor of Travel and Tourism (BTTM), Bachelor of Hotel Management (BHM), Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA), Bachelor of Information Management (BIM), Post Graduate Diploma in Police Science (PGDPS), Master of Business Studies (MBS) and Master of Business Administration (MBA). The Department of Political Science, University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka The Department of Political Science of University of Peradeniya in Sri Lanka joined the NOMA-MPPG program at the fourth quarter of 2008 as a partner in South. Professor A.M. Navaratna Bandara is the Project Coordinator in the partner institution in Sri Lanka. 2 students had been selected from Sri Lanka in 2009 intake through the partner institution for the master degree program (MPPG program). The University of Peradeniya is the heir to the oldest university, founded in July 1, 1942, tradition in Sri Lanka as the successor to the University of Ceylon, the first institution of its kind in the country. It is located on a site of great natural beauty, just 8km from the city of Kandy - the historic capital of last independent kingdom of Sri Lanka, and 100km from Colombo, the current capital of the country. The university consists of seven academic faculties. About 1800 undergraduates enter the university annually, to make up an undergraduate student population of 6600, and the total number of postgraduate students registered is over 1200. Out of the total undergraduate student population, about 5100 are provided accommodation on and around campus. The University celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 1992. The partnering department – “Political Science” at Peradeniya is the first such department to be established in a university in Sri Lanka. However, even before its establishment as a fully fledged department in 1980, several courses in political science were offered in the Special Degree Program in Economics. After being established as a department, we can see a rapid growth in the subject in terms of courses taught, areas specialized in, and the number of students enrolled. In line with new developments in the subject, there was a gradual shift of emphasis towards studying more dynamic aspects of politics. Public administration, international relations, and comparative government were offered as special options. Towards the end of the 1990s further new courses on gender, conflict resolution, human rights, and political violence and terrorism were added to the departmental curriculum. With these developments there was a marked increase in the number of students offering the subject. Today this department has become the focal point in the study of Political Science in the country, providing guidance and resource persons in the preparation of syllabi, textbooks, and the conduct of a range of examinations. It is not surprising that most of the political science teachers of other Sri Lankan universities are drawn from among the products of Peradeniya. With a considerable number of postgraduate students and a senior staff with research experience, the department now lays great emphasis on research. It is also relevant to note that the department offers opportunities for visiting researchers. The National Institute of Development Administration (NIDA), Thailand The National Institute of Development Administration (NIDA) is an advanced educational institution in Thailand to prepare people to become agents of change for development. Recently MPPG Program has signed MOU with NIDA to provide two PhD. scholarships to the students of the MPPG program in each year. Post Doctoral research fund will also be offered to the faculties of NSU under this MOU. Singapore Civil Service College, Singapore Singapore Civil Service College is an apex public sector training institution in the South-East Asia.  At present, Singapore Civil Service College and MPPG, North South University jointly running a three months long training program entitled as ‘Civil Service Change Management Training’. Bangladeshi Civil Servants at the rank of Senior Assistant Secretary are participating in this program. Outreach Publications and Journals Research Area Research Focus One of the major purposes of MPPG is to involve students in research activities to stimulate their thought process and enhance their analytical skills. In this regard, students are encouraged to participate actively in seminars and workshops to learn research techniques and to write scientific papers. The students will also be encouraged to participate in policy seminars/ workshops within and outside the campus Achievements Contacts For further information, please contact Ms. Shireen Akther RubySenior OfficerPhone 88 02 55668200, Ext: 2102Email: shireen.ruby@northsouth.eduPSS Office----------------------Level 09, North Academic Building (NAC), North South University,Plot - 15, Block - B, Bashundhara, Dhaka - 1229, Bangladesh   Office and Services Faculty and Institutional facilities Number of courses in various terms will be taught by members of the faculty at NSU, visiting professors from University of Bergen and University of Tribhuvan and other universities of the region.

Here are the photos of her class:    Guest Speaker from Artolution, USA   Lecture on Community- Based Public Art Education: A Way of Transforming Lives, A Case Study of The Rohingya CommunityCan art transform life? How does it help to overcome trauma in the difficult situations in life? Sociology students of NSU had a chance to think about these questions when they attended the lecture delivered by Dr. Max Frieder. The title of his talk was \"Community- Based Public Art Education: A Way of Transforming Lives, A Case Study of the Rohingya Community\". The lecture was organized by the Center for PeaceStudies (CPS) of the South Asian Institute of Policy and Governance (SIPG), NSU. It took place at the Audi801 of NSU on July 31.   Dr. Frieder is the Chief Creative Officer and Co-Founder of Artolution. This organization has been working in the Rohingya camp in Bangladesh for the last few years where a group of young Rohingya volunteers learn and teach art. A good number of students showed interest to work with Artolution by seeing their extraordinary works to involve. Apart from the Sociology students, the faculty members of NSU attended the lecture,  Dr. Frieder's lively and interactive presentation showed how not only in Bangladesh but in other countries as well, such as Jordan, Bosnia, and African countries, etc., art has been bringing positive changes in lives of people who are deprived of their rights, stateless, and traumatized.     Guest speakers from Print Media of Bangladesh   SOC101 has been inviting guest speakers to the class to help students learn the perspectives of the speakers on various issues related to life and thus see the link between these perspectives and the Sociological concepts.   In Summer 2022, as part of the lecture on media, Dr. Ishrat Sultana invited two guest speakers for her students in two sections. They were Ms Mansura Hossain, a renowned journalist of the Daily Prothom Alo, Bangladesh, and Mr. Sam Jahan, a well known journalist of AFP Bangladesh. Ms. Hossain talked about the role of media in shaping our life and the challenges female journalists face while Mr. Jahan highlighted the biases and representation in the media. They both shared their practical work experiences.   Sociology students enjoyed the class and asked her quite a good number of interesting questions.     Seminar workshop   \n"

      " Center of Excellence in Higher Education The First Private University in Bangladesh Department of Law Notice 29/12/2022 29/12/2022 About Us The Department of Law at North South University strives to produce the next generation of Bangladesh’s most influential lawyers, judges, scholars, and activists. The Department has currently two programs, namely, Bachelor of Laws (LL.B Honors) and Master of Laws (LL.M) in International Commerial Law. The Department of Law, however, is about much more than just learning the letter of the law. Great emphasis is placed on developing the students’ ability to analyze laws, develop an argument, communicate clearly, work as a team, and learn independently. Students are also taught to think critically about the current workings of the justice system and identify potential areas for reform. Anyone interested in learning more about the Department is invited to send an email to the Dept. Secretary at  (regarding the LL.B. program)/ to the Senior Program Officer at  (regarding the LL.M. Program). Chair's Message Arafat Hosen Khan On behalf of my esteemed colleagues and dear students, let me extend a warm welcome from the Department of Law, North South University. We appreciate that you have taken the time to know more about us. The Department of Law is fairly new, but it has a very strong foundation.  Our students are passionate and academically curious, all of our faculty members are legal experts who are dedicated to research and teaching excellence, and we are beginning to forge relationships with some of the most influential lawyers and institutions in Bangladesh. The main goal of the Department of Law is to provide a Common Law based legal education to the students with a view to producing the best lawyers, judges, academics, and policymakers who would be able to attain the leading positions in their respective sectors at home and abroad and serve the humanity.  To us, this means that our students would not just be well versed in the laws of Bangladesh, but also become critical thinkers who would pioneer the development and implementation of innovative, efficient, and just initiatives nationally and internationally.  As we grow, we hope to continue to attract the best and brightest students, build an unparalleled faculty, and partner with brilliant legal scholars and practitioners in Bangladesh and around the world.     Vision of the Department The ever-growing tendencies toward centralization of power in state governments still prevail at the conflict-ridden world. A principal ideology sustaining the nation-state system leads us to perceive a pattern of global social process to protect the individual and national interests. An increasing awareness of the frequency of interactions and communications among people around the globe apparently leads to a homogenization of life patterns, which potentially encourages a rising demand around the globe for a wider participation in framing and sharing of legal and ethical values. The Department of Law offers the undergraduate and post-graduate degrees in law for the dissemination of knowledge for the sake of knowledge alone, and never trends to limit the change of idea, philosophy, jurisprudence and interpretation of laws. The Department is involved in applying a policy of law through wide engagement of its participants in the process of enlightenment and wishes to serve the fundamental goals to which the students are committed as a responsible citizen of the larger community of mankind. The Department expects to be recognized as an effec­tive, proactive and respected center of knowledge creation and dissemination promoting, fostering, and advancing more sustainable human community.   Mission of the Department The Department’s goal is to provide a common law based legal education to the students with a view to producing the best lawyers, judges, and academics who will be able to attain the leading positions in their respective sectors at home and abroad. Students will not just be well versed in the laws of Bangladesh but also critical thinkers who will pioneer the development and implementation of innovative, efficient, and just initiatives nationally and internationally. The Department is equipped with legal experts who are dedicated to research and teaching excellence and provides the best possible learning and practical experience. The Department aspires to serve the citizens of Bangladesh by assisting the legal profession and improving the administration of justice. The Department has modern technology offering the regular court visits, real engagement in the trial of a case, access to journals, law clinic, mooting society and students clubs. The Department opens its doors to entertain the diverse community from different parts of the world to fulfill its mission. Bachelor of Laws (LL.B Honors) Program The Bachelor of Laws (LL.B Honors) program at NSU Department of Law is a full-time, four-year academic journey designed to produce the next generation of Bangladesh’s most influential lawyers, judges, scholars and activists. The programme is also an excellent grounding for many other careers, including politics, policy and government work, as it will provide students with a range of useful oratory, academic and professional skills. The key aim of the Department is to provide international standard legal education that will prepare students for a national, regional and global practice of law in both the public and private fields. The LL.B programme includes study of not only the practical elements of Bangladesh legal system, but also the theoretical and normative perspectives that undergird it, along with the comparison of other common law legal systems around the world. The Department of Law has a very dedicated team of faculty members including the external experts who are always employing their best efforts to regularly update the curriculum. The details of the Bachelor of Laws (LL.B Honors) curricula are linked below:                                                                        Master of Laws (LL.M) Program The Master of Laws (LL.M) program is developed to integrate national and global perspectives on aspects of corporate, international law and other varied areas of law and emphasizes on a transnational and comparative approach to research. The program aims to equip students with skills for global research enabling them to adapt, innovate and apply their knowledge to international legal issues. The objectives of the LL.M program are based on the vision of North South University in imparting globalised legal education with a view of producing world class professionals and academics in the legal arena. The details of the Master of Laws (LL.M) curriculum is linked below:     Career Prospects It is our great pleasure to introduce the youngest Department of North South University, Department of Law which is filled with outstanding students and faculty members. We acknowledge the role played by the law in creating a society as a means to achieving justice for all. We aim to produce LL.B. graduates with a firm knowledge and understanding of the relevant legal principles so that they can contribute to a wide range of contexts such as legal services, local government, politics, policy, the civil service, business, management and administration. In the increasingly competitive environment of worldwide access to higher education, the Department continues to offer a guarantee of quality, value and intellectual rigor to ensure social justice. The Department of Law at North South University is a center for learning, research, creative teaching and systematic instruction as well as guidance for the students. So the goal of the Department is to educate students who are employable in a variety of legal settings and can contribute to the development of justice. To achieve this goal we provide students with a rigorous program of legal education so that they are committed to the rule of law, equity, justice, fairness and high ethical standards; to acquire and improve professional skills, to represent clients without fear or favour, to promote equality of opportunity and to provide an exceptional legal service. The Department encourages students to become leaders in improving the administration of justice and to incorporate public service as an integral component of their legal careers as well as to contribute to the development of the law and the improvement of legal education through scholarly and other professional activities. Studying law at NSU Law Department goes beyond lectures, papers and exams. The Department of Law conducts LL.B. (Hons.) program throughout the academic year with distinguished faculty members and experts. The Law Department is committed to offering different courses throughout the 12th semester, to qualify graduates adequately for various competitive examinations including those conducted by the Bar Council and Judicial Service Commission. The students are expected to serve the nation by contributing to a host of legal professions particularly in judicial, legal and administrative services; financial and commercial institutions; research and policy making areas; and public and international organizations. The learning objectives of the Department include: To understand the Bangladeshi legal system and lawyers' principal roles in that system. To read, understand and use cases to construct legal arguments. To read, understand and use statutes and other enacted rules to solve legal problems or construct legal arguments. To predict the probable judicial resolution of simulated legal disputes. To write a memorandum predicting the probable judicial resolution of a simulated legal dispute in a form that conforms to basic professional conventions regarding analytic support, organization and style. To conduct basic legal research. To recognize excellent writing in and about law, and to learn techniques for improving one’s own writing. To learn techniques for time-management, self-reflection and collaboration to support ongoing acquisition of information and skills necessary for successful academic study and professional practice. To learn techniques of persuasive written advocacy. In addition to the above curriculum, the department oversees a ‘Law and Mooting Society’ for developing advocacy skills and promoting mooting activities among the law students at the University. The activities of the society include the following: training/workshops on advocacy and mooting; lecture series delivered by advocacy experts; training sessions for moot teams participating in different mooting competitions; programs enhancing legal research skills for its members and so on. Career prospects of NSU law graduates: A law degree is a gateway to a career as an advocate or judge at lower judiciary, but it is not the only path that a student can choose; there are many options beyond the legal profession that are available for the graduates. Jobs related to the LL.B. (Honors) degree include: -          Practicing civil and criminal law both at lower and higher judiciary. -          Judicial Service. -          Academic research and teaching. -          Paralegal -          Legal Analyst and Advisor. -          Compliance Specialist. -          Negotiation, Mediator, Arbitrator and Conflict Resolution specialist. -          Job at UN organizations like UNHCR, UNDP, UNEP, WFP, UNICEF, UNESCO, ILO. -          Development Agencies. The knowledge a student will gain in studying law at North South University will no doubt be useful, at least for a time, but the real value of studying law is the development of an analytical and sometimes imaginative approach to problem solving, critical thinking and self-discipline. This will far outlast any knowledge and provide you with a strong foundation for many careers worldwide.

The exact cut off points for assigning letter grades is at the discretion of individual instructor. The same applies to the assignment of + or – after a letter grade. It is meant to give more flexibility so that shades of performance can be distinguished and rewarded. The + and – has a value of 0.3 grade point. Grade point average Students' grade point averages are numerical values obtained by dividing the total grade points earned by the credit attempted. Only courses graded A, A-, B, B-, C+, C-, D-, D and F are used to determine credits attempted. Only the grades earned in the courses that are required for a degree are included in the GPA calculation. Grades earned in the other courses are reported on the transcript but are not counted in calculated GPA. GPA- class equivalent NSU students are graded on GPA. Comparison of the GPA earned by NSU student to the Classes earned by students in other universities in the country is as follows: GPA 3.00 and above = First class GPA 2.50 to 2.99 = Second class GPA 2.00 to 2.49 = Third class  Grade change Grade change is strongly discouraged. Letter grades may be changed only for posting error or errors in calculation. If a grade change is inevitable, it must be completed within one semester following the submission of the grade. The program directors and department chairs will ask for necessary papers and records to substantiate the grade change. Incomplete (I) The grade of incomplete (I) may be used in special circumstances. The incomplete may be given only at the end of a semester to a student whose work is progressing, but who has left unfinished a small amount of work for completion without further class attendance. The instructor must file with register an incomplete Grade from describing the work to be completed, indicating a tentative final grade to be assigned if the work is not completed and the time period in which the work must be completed (no longer than the following semester). The student has the responsibility to take initiative in completing the work and is expected to make up the incomplete as specified by the instructor. If action is not taken the \"I\" grade will revert to the tentative final grade. The final grade becomes an \"F\" if no tentative grade is assigned. In the event the instructor from whom a student received an incomplete is not available, the disposition of a case involving an incomplete grade resides with the Head of the Department. The grade \"I\" must be replaced within one semester after the grade is assigned. Withdrawal (W) The grade Withdrawal (W) is assigned when a student officially drops a course during the period between end of third and sixth weeks. Prior to that time if a student drops a course no entry is made on the academic record. A \"W\" does not affect the student's GPA. Retaking courses Students may choose to repeat a course, but such repetition will be allowed for only once in each course. The current policy regarding retaking courses is as follows: A student may retake a course/s if the grade is B (plain) or lower. The chance will be given only once for a course. The best grade will be counted for CGPA calculation. The above policy will be applicable to all students (graduate / undergraduate) studying at NSU. When a student retakes a course in which s/he must apply not to include the \"F\" grade(s) in her CGPA calculation. An \"F\" grade earned in any credit course will be used to calculate CGPA until the course is retaken and an application is submitted. The retake policy in case of courses with \"F\" grades will apply immediately to all students at NSU irrespective of their date of enrolment. Students who wish to retake a course again will be assessed tuition and applicable fees. A prescribed retake form is available in the registers office. Students must fill it out and submit it to the Registers office. Abandoning course Grade F will be recorded for students who have not fulfilled academic obligations and have not obtained a grade, and for students who abandon their course without officially withdrawing from a course. Required GPA for Degree Undergraduate: The student requires 2.5 CGPA for getting BSc degree. Graduate: The student requires 3.0 CGPA for getting MSc degree. ** For Graduate student having CGPA lower than 3.2 might not be included in thesis group by the department. Probation Probation will be given to the student having CGPA lower than 2.0 for both Undergraduate and Graduate programs. Probation is count as a warning to the student to increase his/her CGPA. Student will be given three consecutive semesters to increase his/her CGPA to 2.0.  After third probation student will be dismissed from the program.

Mooting is based on a fictional dispute between parties or countries before the National or International Court of Justice. The dispute will cover legal issues which are realistic, cutting edge national and international legal questions. The students, as mooters, will provide strong arguments both as prosecution and defence and will submit written advocacy documents of their arguments and logic, which will be known as memorial. The NSULMS will also begin with the Street Law program in different schools and colleges of Bangladesh which may encourage the prospective candidates to join the Department of Law of North South University. The NSULMS at the North South University has started its journey with a commitment to promote mooting talents and to facilitate the law students to achieve a practical legal education which will bring success in their future legal career. The society will also play an important role in career development through organizing special lectures, seminars, workshops and interactive sessions with reputed national and international organizations and personals of concerned sector. The society also aims to represent the North South University in national and international legal arena.Ms. (Senior Lecturer, Department of Law) is currently employed as the Faculty Advisor of this society.

Jahangir Alam, Regulatory Assistant, Marico Bangladesh Limited and Faria Ahmed, Legal Consultant, Marico Bangladesh Limited. The session was hosted exclusively for the students of the Department of Law. Professor Md. Rizwanul Islam, Chair, Department of Law, gave the introductory remarks and served as the moderator for the session. The Department of Law, North South University celebrated the inauguration ceremony of the North South University Law and Mooting Society (NSULMS) on 16 April 2017. Honorable State Minister for Labour and Employment Md Mujibul Haque Chunnu was the Chief Guest while Pro-Vice Chancellor (Designate) Professor Dr. GU Ahasan was the special guest of the program. The ceremony was chaired by Professor Dr. Abdur Rob Khan, Dean, School of Humanities and Social Sciences. Professor Dr. Gour Gobinda Goswami, Treasurer, NSU was present as the guest of honor. Dr. Abu Noman M. Atahar Ali, Chairman, Department of Law and the Director of the NSULMS was also present in the event.   From the 11th to the 13th of December 2017, the Law and Mooting Society (NSULMS) in North South University had organized what they called the ‘biggest assembly of young legal minds’, the NSU Law Fest Season I. While law fests in Bangladesh are unheard of, NSULMS settled for one that was themed after the popular television series ‘Game of Thrones’. The law fest was open for undergraduate and postgraduate law students of all universities in the country. The first day started with the launching ceremony of the Master of Laws (LL.M) programme by the Chief Guest, Advocate Mr. Md. Fazle Rabbi Miah, Hon’ble Deputy Speaker of the Parliament.   On 13 December 2017 the NSULMS organized a seminar on International Law. Justice Dr. Syed Refaat Ahmed, Hon’ble Judge of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh delivered a lecturer on this seminar. An Oxford scholar and a magnificent speaker, it was not only a pleasure to hear from him, but it was rather a matter of privilege for many of my students who had instantly idolized him due to his sophistication and charisma.   On the 2nd day of March, 2017, it was a pleasure on IQAC's part to have sponsored two sessions of lectures by Dr. Md. Rizwanul Islam, Associate Professor of the School of Law at BRAC University. A former Casual Lecturer of Macquarie University and recipient of the Macquarie University Research Excellence Scholarship, Dr. Md. Rizwanul Islam has extensively published on International Trade Law. Given his research credentials, the Department of Law invited Dr. Md. Rizwanul Islam to make deliberations on 'Writing a PhD Research Proposal and Applying for Research Grants' and 'Law Journal Articles: How to Write and Where to Publish'. Listeners were the Core and Part-time Faculty Members of the Department of Law. Both sessions were particularly useful for most of the faculty members who plan on pursuing doctoral studies in the near future. While blending into the needs of the West may limit the chances of receiving Grants, Dr. Md. Rizwanul Islam has stressed on publishing not only at refereed journals, but at those of high repute. It is a matter of pride that Dr. Md. Rizwanul Islam is now an Associate Professor of the Department of Law, North South University.   On the 6th of April, 2017, Dr. Rumana Islam, an Associate Professor of Law at Dhaka University has graced an event sponsored by IQAC, as the guest discussant, on the topic- 'Choosing the right PhD topic (Law)'. Upon graduating from Dhaka, Dr. Rumana has educated herself at Cambridge and Warwick, UK. She is a Commonwealth Scholar and heads the Editorial Board of the Bangladesh Journal of Law by the Bangladesh Institute of Law and International Affairs (BILIA). She has an outstanding list of publications at international peer reviewed journals at the area of commercial law. Dr. Rumana in her discussion has mentioned that relating burning issues such as BREXIT to one's topic of interest, and developing a research proposal accordingly, is likely to open the scope of receiving PhD grants. She also focused on how proposing a topic does not necessarily require the attempt of drawing a conclusion, rather should contain statements of problems that remain unsolved till date. Given that the Department of Law at NSU consists of a young batch of potential faculty members who are expected to pursue doctorate degrees in the near future, the discussion was extremely fruitful.   On the 10th day of July, 2017, the Institutional Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) and the Department of Laworganized a day long workshop, with the presence of eminent legal personalities from Dhaka University, Professor Dr. Mizanur Rahman, Ex-Chairman of the National Human Rights Commission, and Dr. Rumana Islam, Associate Professor of Law. The existing Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) curriculum was scrutinized and changes were suggested by the participants that consisted of faculty members of the Department of Law. The workshop also had substantial contribution in the designing of the Master’s of Laws (LL.M.) curriculum.   On 13 July 2017, the Department of Law, North South University organised Bangladesh Law Students' Symposium (BLSS) at its campus. The symposium is the brainchild of Mr. Saquib Rahman, Lecturer at the Department of Law. The Hon'ble Minister of Water Resources, Barrister Anisul Islam Mahmud MP graced the occasion as Chief Guest. Interested law students from all over the country were requested to email abstracts of not more than 350words on any discipline of law. The symposium committee asked for full papers of the 10 best selected, fopresentation in front of a panel of experts comprising of distinguished legal academics and practitioners at the Symposium. North South University Law & Mooting Society (NSULMS) coordinated the organization of this symposium.     On the 19th of October 2017, Professor Dr. Borhan Uddin Khan, Chairman of the Department of Law of Dhaka University was present as the guest speaker at a roundtable discussion on the ‘Learning outcomes from law courses’. Professor Khan with decades of experience as an academic had much to deliver, that would be of benefit for the students of the Department of Law, North South University.   Upcoming Events NSU Law International Webinars To widen the students' perception about law and give them more exposure to the theories and also practical application of the law, the Department routinely organises lectures by legal experts. It organises webinars hosting the world's leading academic legal minds and practitioners to speak on contemporary legal topics.   Antinomies and Aporias in Official Human Rights Solidarity Argumentation Across the Global South/North Axis: Recovering the Power/Interest - Norms/Values Nexus.

Our Department started its journey back in 2006. Since then we are maintaining a long tradition of excellence in teaching and research. It has only been possible because of the faculty, students and staff dedicated to promote cutting edge research, outstanding teaching and service to the university. In addition, the establishment of NSU Genome Research Institute (NGRI) in 2017 has expanded the dimension of research in microbial genetics & pathogenesis, genomics, biochemistry, molecular biology and immunology at the department. As scientific investigators, faculties here are not only engaged in teaching but also in training the next generation of talented young scientists who will meet the challenges of the 21st century. Our research spans the broad areas of Microbiology, Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Under the current global crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Microbiology and Biochemistry are the sciences that have emerged as the vital source of information to combat this notorious agent. The department focuses in developing young individuals who will contribute to the academia, industry, government and non-government organizations locally and internationally in the days ahead. Therefore, students enrolled in our programs have the unique opportunity to receive quality education for the personal and professional growth. Our research efforts which are supported by the university and external funds allow students to make novel and intriguing observations that they can present in national and international meetings and publish in national and international peer-reviewed journals. Students also have the opportunity to participate in several student organizations including “The NSU Bioscience Club” which is supervised by one of our esteemed faculty members. The purpose of this club is to promote students’ interest in life sciences and connect them with the academic and professional world. We are indeed proud of our internationally recognized faculty members, all of whom have MS and/or PhD degrees primarily from the USA, Canada, UK, Japan and Australia. Our outstanding faculties and their exceptional teams of undergraduate and graduate researchers are the key to our success.

The same applies to the assignment of + or - after a letter grade. It is meant to give more flexibility so that shades of performance can be distinguished and rewarded. The + and - has a value of 0.3 grade point.  Grade Point Average (GPA) Students' grade-point averages are numerical values obtained by dividing the total grade points earned by the credits attempted. Only courses' graded A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, and F are used to determine credits attempted.Only the grades earned in the courses that are required for a degree are included in the GPA calculation. Grades earned in other courses are reported on the transcript but are not counted in calculating the GPA.   GPA - Class Equivalence NSU students are graded on GP A. Comparison of the GPA earned by NSU students to the Classes earned by students in other universities in the country is as follows:GPA 3.00 and above = First ClassGPA 2.50 to 2.99 = Second ClassGP A 2.00 to 2.49 = Third Class Grade Change Grade change is strongly discouraged. Letter grades may be changed only for posting errors or errors in calculation. If a grade change is inevitable, it must be completed within one semester following the submission of the grade. The program directors and department chairs will ask for necessary papers and records to substantiate the grade change. Incomplete (I) The grade of Incomplete (I) may be used in special circumstances. The Incomplete may be given only at the end of a semester to a student whose work is progressing, \"but who has left unfinished a small amount of work for completion without further class attendance. The instructor must file with the Registrar an Incomplete Grade form describing the work to be completed, indicating a tentative final grade to be assigned if the work is not completed and the time period in which the work must be completed (no longer than the following semester).The student has the responsibility to take the initiative in completing the work and is expected to make up the incomplete as specified by the instructor. If action is not taken the \"I\" grade will revert to the tentative final grade. The final grade becomes an \"F\" if no tentative grade is assigned. In the event the instructor from whom a student received an incomplete is not available, the disposition of a case involving an incomplete grade resides with the Head of the Department. The grade 'I' must be replaced within one semester after the grade is assigned. Withdrawal (W) The grade Withdrawal (W) is assigned when a student officially drops a course during the period between the ends of the third and sixth week. Prior to that time if a student drops a course no entry is made on the academic record. A \"W\" does not affect the student's GP A. Retaking Courses A student may repeat a course in which the grade is 'B' or lower. When a student retakes a course, the actual grade will be recorded. In case of a retake course, only the best grade will be used to calculate the CGPA. An \"F\" grade earned in any credit course will be used to calculate CGPA until the course is retaken/ replaced by taking another appropriate course, and a better grade is obtained. The retake policy in case of courses with \"F\" grades applies to all students of NSU irrespective of their date of enrollment. Generally, there will be no limit on the number of times a course can be retaken. A student who wishes to retake a course must register for the course again, and will be assessed for tuition and applicable fees Abandoning Course Grades F will be recorded for students who have not fulfilled academic obligations and have not obtained a grade, and for students who abandon their courses without officially withdrawing from a course.     \n"

      " Center of Excellence in Higher Education The First Private University in Bangladesh Student Records University Policy NSU maintains various student records to document academic progress and to record interactions with University staff and officials. To protect each student's right to privacy the University has an established policy for handling student records. Interpretation of this policy is based on experience with educational records, and the policy itself may subsequently be modified in light of this experIence. Directory Information Certain information concerning students is considered to be open to the public upon inquiry. This public information is called directory information and includes a student's name, local address, and telephone number, mailing address, major, classification, date and place of birth, dates of attendance at NSU, awards and academic honors, degrees and dates awarded, previously attended educational institutions, participation in officially recognized University activities and sports, and the height and weight of members of athletic teams. Directory information as defined above will be released for individual students by the Office of the Registrar to anyone upon inquiry, unless the student has requested within ten days after registering that specific items not be released. The student's request to have directory information withheld must be submitted for each semester the student is registered and should be made at the Office of the Registrar, which will notify other appropriate University offices. Confidential Information With the exception of the information noted above, student records are generally considered to be confidential. Each type of student record is the responsibility of a designated University official, and only that person or the Vice Chancellor, Pro Vice Chancellor or superior to whom that person reports has authority to release the record. Release of Grades Reports of students' grades are routinely sent to the students. Parents of dependent students may obtain grades by written request to the University Registrar. Proof of dependency is required. The grades of other students will be sent to their parents only with written permission of the student. Withholding Records In the case of a student who is delinquent in an account to the University or against whom official disciplinary action has been taken, the appropriate University official may request that the student's record not be released. The effect of this action is that transcripts are not released and registration forms are withheld. In order for the action to be rescinded, the Registrar's Office must receive written authorization from the official who originally requested the action, indicating that the student has met the obligation. Transcripts A transcript is a certified, official copy of a student's academic record. Because the transcript contains confidential information, it cannot be furnished or released to anyone but the student or parents of dependent students without a specific request signed by the student. Each transcript costs Tk. 200.00. The required fee must be paid in advance. A transcript request must be made in person or in writing to the Registrar's Office. It cannot be taken over the telephone. Transcript requests will not be honored for a student with a delinquency to the University. Undergraduate Degree Requirements As NSU is based on the US University system, all undergraduate degrees are of four years duration. For each degree, except B.A. in English, at least 124 credits are required. A minimum of 123 credit is required for B.A. in English degree. If an undergraduate student takes 15-16 credits per semester then it will take approximately 8 semesters to complete degree requirements. This can be done in less than four years if a student registers for more than two semesters in some years, has sufficient proficiency in English and Mathematics, and plans the schedules well. Students are responsible for meeting degree requirements. Before selecting the courses in each semester students should consult their academic advisor. The University reserves the right to change programs and curricula without notice whenever circumstances warrant such changes. Meeting graduation requirements is each student's responsibility. They include the following: 1. A minimum of 124 credits (123 for B.A. in English) for a bachelor's degree of which at least 60 must have been earned at NSU as a student admitted into a degree program (residency requirement) . 2. Completion of all course requirements for the degree including major, minor, concentration, GEd etc. 3. At least a 2.00 (C) cumulative grade point average in all University courses attempted and a 2.5 in all degree core and concentration electives required for graduation. A student must earn a grade of D or better to pass a course. 4. Clearance from NSU Accounts and Library. Fulfillment of the above conditions does not necessarily mean that a degree will be conferred on the student. The University reserves the right to refuse the awarding of a degree on disciplinary and other grounds. The courses comprising the 124-credit requirement can be categorized as follows. General Education (GEd) Courses These courses (27 credits) are required of all students regardless of degree, major or minor concentration. They should be completed early in a student's program (first two years) at NSU. A course which is a prerequisite for a GEd course does not satisfy the GEd requirement, but such a course may meet the minimum degree requirement of 124 credits. Courses taken to fulfill core or elective categories may also satisfy the general education requirement. GEd requirements for all department except English are: 3 credits of Mathematics (MAT125 or higher level) 6 credits of English composition (ENG1O3 and ENG1O5, or higher level) 3 credits of Computer Science / Information Systems 3 credits of Environmental Studies 3 credits of Basic Science from the disciplines of Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Earth Sciences 9 credits of liberal arts, humanities, social sciences, and business, in disciplines other than the student's degree. Core Courses These are the courses specifically required for a degree (BBA, BA, and BS). The required credits vary for each degree, but comprise approximately 60% of the total degree requirement. Students must maintain at least a 2.5 grade point average in these courses in order to graduate. Major Concentration These are courses specifically required for major concentration within a degree. The credits required vary, but combined with other electives they comprise approximately 10% of the degree requirement. Students must maintain at least a 2.5 grade point average in these courses in order to graduate. Minor Concentration All Programs offer Minor in each of the concentration areas. Students may choose to do a Minor in addition to their major concentration by completing additional course requirements. The Minor concentration broadens students' specialization and increases their marketability. A student may complete the requirements for a Minor concentration without increasing the total credit-hour requirements for the BBA degree because, the same courses may fulfill the open elective requirement. Open Electives Any course selected by a student to fulfill the degree requirement of 124 credits after core, major, minor and GEd requirements are satisfied, is open electives course. These are selected according to availability and student's preference. Dual Major Departments and Programs, also offer Dual Major. A student has to fulfill the requirements for two major concentration areas to obtain a Dual Major Internship An internship is a program whereby a student, usually after completing all courses, undertakes an affiliation with an organization, under faculty supervision, for the purpose of applying knowledge gained from their NSU studies and to gain experience in the business world. The Department of Career Services provides assistance to students in arranging internships. Such experiences are approved in advance by the faculty advisor and can last from 8-10 weeks after which the student is assigned credits and grades based on an evaluation by the faculty supervisor, by a staff where the internship is performed, and a written report prepared by the intern. Credits assigned may vary for internships. Special projects or research work of high standard may be substituted for an internship when formally authorized in advance by the Academic Council. Internships can also be used as electives or to replace a required course if approved in advance by the Academic Council. Conditions of Internship Students must complete at least 100 credits to be eligible for internship. Students shall not be registered into any course during internship unless authorized by the Department Head and'the Dean, Duration of Internship For purpose of fulfilling degree requirement, students should be interned in organizations ideally for 8-10 weeks allowing two to three more weeks for preparing draft and final reports.
